# Discord bot 'Legion'
## by DaveMitHut

### Preface
I wrote this little discord bot for my own private server in april 2019.
In April 2020 we moved this bot to the server for our streaming community
"Helden Auf Papier". In July/August 2020 I rewrote the bot in Python and
added additional functions for twitch integration and more.

The bot has basic functions related to *Magic: The Gathering*, *Dungeons
& Dragons* and RPGs in general. It is named after the character 'Legion'
from the Mass Effect games.

### Functions
This bot has some basic functions related to *Magic: The Gathering*, *Dungeons
& Dragons* and other RPGs, like displaying cards and rulings or rolling dice. All
functions are described in the following table:

**Name** | **Additional Aliases** | **Function**
---- | ----- | --------
**!commands** | !command | display all available commands
**!roll xdx** |  | roll the specified number of a specified dice
**!card cardname** | !cards | display an image for the specified card
**!rulings cardname** | !ruling | display all available rulings for the specified card
**!legality cardname** | !legalities, !legal | display the legality of the specified card for the standard, modern & commander formats

### Additional functions
In addition to the specified functions above, this bot will also greet all new
server members with a specific message and information on how to view all available
commands. Furthermore, the bot will grant specific permissions to every new member of
the server. If you type an invalid command, the bot will notify you and instruct you
how to view all valid commands.
